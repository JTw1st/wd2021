    <p><strong>Hey!</strong> My name is Yehor Miezientsev and I'm perspective student of Taras Shevchenko National
        University of Kyiv. Frankly speaking, I already have an experience working for some major corporations, such
        as:<em> Tesla, SpaceX, Microsoft, Oracle </em> many many others. I consult top 10 CTO and CISO like Mark
        McArdle, Ryan Fay, Mike D. Kail, Oliver Bussmann and so much more.</p>

    <h2 id="mystudy">My Study</h2>
    <p>Talking about my education, I always wanted to get the most juice as I actually can. So I decided to study at
        Westminster School first and then enter the University of Cambridge and continue my education there. That's what
        I did. So why I study in Ukraine? Well, I'm such a genius, that I have already finished my study abroad. It only
        took me 5 years to get my PhD. But this doesn't answer the question, righ? Yeah, I have to spend my time in
        Ukraine cause my friends own some gas pumping facilities there and I, as a professional in information security,
        should make sure that everything on the technical side is secure and inaccessible by adversaries.</p>
    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <p>Moving up to my skills. Well, there are plenty of them. On my weekends I usually fly to the UK to meet my friends
        and play golf. Otherwise I spend the entire days studying networking (no, that's not just communication with
        people). I attend Mikrotik courses and have plenty of their certs, such as</p>
